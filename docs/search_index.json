Click through each section for additional information and resources. 1.1 Step 1. Getting to know R Learning to code is learning a new language! Before jumping straight into analyzing data, it’s important to know how the R language works. 1.2 Step 2. library(DiagrammeR) library(htmlwidgets) # Create a flowchart with links to bookdown chapters graph &lt;- grViz(&quot; digraph flowchart { node [shape = box, style = filled, fillcolor = lightblue] # Nodes with embedded hyperlinks to bookdown chapters A [label = &lt;&lt;TABLE BORDER=\\&quot;0\\&quot;&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD HREF=\\&quot;https://yourbookdownsite.com/introduction.html\\&quot; TARGET=\\&quot;_blank\\&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&gt;] B [label = &lt;&lt;TABLE BORDER=\\&quot;0\\&quot;&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD HREF=\\&quot;https://yourbookdownsite.com/chapter1.html\\&quot; TARGET=\\&quot;_blank\\&quot;&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&gt;] C [label = &lt;&lt;TABLE BORDER=\\&quot;0\\&quot;&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD HREF=\\&quot;https://yourbookdownsite.com/chapter2.html\\&quot; TARGET=\\&quot;_blank\\&quot;&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&gt;] D [label = &lt;&lt;TABLE BORDER=\\&quot;0\\&quot;&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD HREF=\\&quot;https://yourbookdownsite.com/conclusion.html\\&quot; TARGET=\\&quot;_blank\\&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&gt;] # Edges A -&gt; B B -&gt; C C -&gt; D } &quot;) # Display the graph graph "],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!
