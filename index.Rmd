# Roadmap

This outlines the coding skill & techniques building blocks to complete data analyses & visualization with R. Click through each section for additional information and resources.

## Step 1. Getting to know R
Learning to code is learning a new language! Before jumping straight into analyzing data, it's important to know how the R language works.

## Step 2.

```{r}
library(DiagrammeR)
library(htmlwidgets)

# Create a flowchart with links to bookdown chapters using section IDs
graph <- grViz("
digraph flowchart {
  node [shape = box, style = filled, fillcolor = lightblue]

  # Nodes with embedded hyperlinks to bookdown chapters using section IDs
  A [label = <<TABLE BORDER=\"0\"><TR><TD HREF=\"./index.html#introduction\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Introduction</TD></TR></TABLE>>]
  B [label = <<TABLE BORDER=\"0\"><TR><TD HREF=\"./index.html#intro\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Chapter 1</TD></TR></TABLE>>]
